This is my two player game. 

Game Description:
Each player tries to 'eat' their 'food' by moving their player icon over the black circle, thus gaining 10 points. 
If they hit the edges of the game their score decreases by 10 points, unless their points are already zero. 
The player moves faster every time they eat some food, making it harder but also faster to gain more points. The first player to 100 points wins. 

Each player is an instance of the Snake class, and interacts with the food that is created outside of the class.

Game Controls:
Player1(Red) controls are:
